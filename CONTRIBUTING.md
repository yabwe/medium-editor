## Code Consitency

To help create consistent looking code throughout the project, we use a few tools to help us. They have plugins for most popular editors/IDEs to make coding for our project, but you should use them in your project as well!

#### JSHint

We use [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) on each build to find easy-to-catch errors and potential problems in our js.  You can find our JSHint settings in the `.jshintrc` file in the root of the project.

#### jscs

We use [jscs](http://jscs.info/) on each build to enforce some code style rules we have for our project.  You can find our jscs settings in the `.jscsrc` file in the root of the project.

#### EditorConfig

We use [EditorConfig](http://EditorConfig.org) to maintain consistent coding styles between various editors and IDEs.  You can find our settings in the `.editorconfig` file in the root of the project.

## Development

MediumEditor development tasks are managed by Grunt. To install all the necessary packages, just invoke:

```bash
npm install
```

To run all the test and build the dist files for testing on demo pages, just invoke:
```bash
grunt
```

These are the other available grunt tasks:

* __js__: runs jslint and jasmine tests and creates minified and concatenated versions of the script;
* __css__: runs autoprefixer and csslint
* __test__: runs jasmine tests, jslint and csslint
* __watch__: watch for modifications on script/scss files
* __spec__: runs a task against a specified file

The source files are located inside the __src__ directory.  Be sure to make changes to these files and not files in the dist directory.
